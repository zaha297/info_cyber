# Encryption Techniques
## Learning Objectives
- Understand cryptography basics
- Differentiate between symmetric and asymmetric encryption
- Learn hashing and digital signature concepts

## Cryptography
Cryptography is a technique of securing information and communications using codes to ensure confidentiality,integrity and authentication
## Symmetric Encryption
- Uses one key for both encryption and decryption
- Fast,suitable for bulk data encryption
## Asymmetric Encription
- Uses two keys: Public key (for encryption) & Private Key (for decryption)
- Used for secure key exchange and digital communication
## Hashing
- Converts data into a fixed-length string
- One-way process - cannot be reversed
- Used for password storage and integrity  checking
- Common Algorithms: SHA-256,MD5(deprecated)
## Digital Signatures and Certificates 
-  Ensure authenticity and non-repudiation
-  A digital signature uses private key to sign data and public key to verify
-  Certificates (X.509) are issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs) for trust verifivation(used in HTTPS)

## Example:
- browser verifies certificate signed by CA to ensure authenticity
